# wslfilesync
wslfilesync is a tool for bidirectional synchronization of directories.

## Problem:
When developing under Windows, it is impossible to work with Docker due to very slow synchronization between the primary and virtual file systems. The main solution is to copy files somewhere into the virtual FS. But then two problems arise:
Files generated by the program are not sent back to the primary file system
Editing files from an editor, such as vscode, is impossible
Passing inotify from the primary system to WSL does not work, so rsync bypasses it

## How it works
wslfilesync scans the primary directory for changes and copies these changes to the synchronized directory, and does the same with the synchronized vice versa.
WARNING: tool deletes everything in B directory on startup.

## Build
```./build.sh``` - just build it

## Run
- Open WSL
- Run ```./bin/wslfilesync -a <main directory> -b <secondary directory>```

## To do
- More async
- Optimize update loop
- Dokerize
- Process permissions right way
- Tests
